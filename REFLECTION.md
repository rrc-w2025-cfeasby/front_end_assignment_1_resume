## 1. Can I explain what me code does?

My code displays basic HTML page with a image tag of my picture at the top and my name and the title of the job market I am interested in.

My code segments work together by keeping the code semantically correct and without any validation errors.

## 2. What was my coding process?

I started with the basic HTML structure and tried keeping it fairly semantically correct until further on when I dealt with the validation errors and warnings etc. 

I generally always start basic and slowly add on new functionality. In this assignment I worked off the example HTML picture posted on Learn. It is very helpful for me to see a completed version and then simply replicate it.

## 3. What challenges did I have?

*None*. This is *easy* as it gets. Only thing I needed to get a better idea of was the ARIA labelling as I thought role was for everything I wanted, but no I needed to use aria-label="Contact Information" as an example not role="contact_information", good to know but wasn't exactly a challenge!

## 4. What would I do differently now?

Add CSS and JavaScript to get some styles and script functionality going! Hate waiting but I will!
